## Overview

This is my first solution from Frontend Mentor challenges. I have tried to keep my code clean and short as possible. I hope everyone appreciates my take on this challenge.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I tried to keep this code clean and short. I observed the design file and tried to define common veriables so that I can make defined veriables and properties. I like to work in .scss file as it allows CSS nesting. Observations such as dividing the content into groups makes it simpler to create the required design.
