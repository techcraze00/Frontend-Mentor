- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I tried to keep this code clean and short. I observed the design file and tried to define common veriables so that I can make defined veriables and properties. I like to work in .scss file as it allows CSS nesting. Observations such as dividing the content into groups makes it simpler to create the required design.
